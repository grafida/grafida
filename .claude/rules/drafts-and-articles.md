# Local drafts & the Articles screen

The `src/Article/` notes from `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Layout` section. Verbatim — the leading `- `
and two-space continuation indent are the original bullet formatting.

- `src/Article/` — `Draft` entity + repository (local drafts). A draft remembers the
  `site_id` + `remote_id` it mirrors; `findByRemote()` locates an existing draft for a
  remote article and `update()` can re-point a draft at another site (which unlinks it).
  The **alias (URL slug)** is an editable field in the editor, shown as an input with an
  attached "regenerate" add-on button (`#editor-alias-input` / `#btn-regenerate-alias`)
  directly below the title. The SPA's `makeAlias()` mirrors Joomla's
  `ApplicationHelper::stringUrlSafe()`, which is **two** algorithms picked by the site's
  `unicodeslugs` Global Configuration option (the references payload's `unicodeSlugs` flag, see
  `src/Reference/` — which since gh-61 may be the site's own `UnicodeAliases` override rather than
  anything read from the site), so `aliasSlug(text, unicodeSlugs, language)` mirrors both: off
  (Joomla's default) → `OutputFilter::stringURLSafe` (transliteration → lowercase →
  whitespace-to-dash → strip non-`[a-z0-9-]` → trim dashes), on →
  `OutputFilter::stringUrlUnicodeSlug` (letters kept as they
  are: only URL-breaking punctuation becomes a space, `?` is dropped, lowercase, runs of **spaces**
  — not whitespace at large — to a dash, no dash trimming). This is why a Greek title yields
  `καλημέρα-κόσμε` on a Unicode-alias site; either way
  an empty result (Joomla counts an all-dashes alias as empty, as `Table\Content::check()` does)
  falls back to a `Y-m-d-H-i-s` timestamp.
  ⚠️ **Transliteration is per *article* language, and it is a module, not a `normalize('NFKD')`
  call** (gh-61). Joomla's `OutputFilter::stringUrlSafe($string, $language)` goes through
  `Language::transliterate()`, which a language pack may replace wholesale with its own
  `xx-XX.localise.php`; `js/util/translit.js` reproduces that — Joomla's shared
  `Transliterate::$utf8LowerAccents` map plus `de`/`fr`/`el` providers chosen on the **primary
  subtag**, so `de-DE`/`de-AT`/`de-CH` share one. Three things to carry:
  - **A provider overrides the shared map rather than adding to it**, because it runs first and
    consumes the characters it cares about. That is not an optimisation: the shared map's umlaut
    rules are *German* ones (`ü` → `ue`) and French needs `aiguë` → `aigue`. Adding a language
    means adding a map, never editing the shared one.
  - **`makeAlias()` reads the language off `#editor-language`, not off the draft**, so picking a
    language in the sidebar and pressing regenerate uses the language just picked.
  - **The trailing NFKD pass is deliberate divergence from Joomla**, which simply drops a letter
    its map does not know. It is safe *because* Joomla re-slugifies whatever alias we send: `à` →
    `a` passes its filter unchanged, so the preview stays accurate and salvages a letter Joomla
    would have thrown away. `tests/js/translit.test.mjs` is the only coverage — PHP has no
    transliterator, since nothing server-side ever generates an alias.
  Distinct from that URL slug, the **Created by Alias** (`created_by_alias`, a person's by-line —
  Joomla shows it instead of the publishing account's name) is a plain sidebar text input
  (`#editor-created-by-alias`, gh-8). It is the one article attribute `PublishService` sends
  **unconditionally**, where `metadesc`/`metakey` are sent only when non-empty: an empty value is
  meaningful ("credit the real author"), and a PATCH backfills every column we omit from the
  *existing* record, so an alias the user cleared could otherwise never be cleared on the site. The
  draft is authoritative because importing a remote article reads the site's value back into it.
  ⚠️ The write survives because `ApiController::save()` filters the body through com_content's
  `article.xml` form — a field absent from that form is silently dropped, so *any* new article
  attribute must be checked against it first.
  `regenerateAlias(force)` fills the alias from the title on the title's **blur** only when the
  alias is empty (never clobbering a hand-edited one), while the button always regenerates.
  Joomla re-slugifies whatever alias we send on publish, so this is a faithful preview.
  Editing a remote article fetches its full content via `GET /api/sites/{id}/articles/{articleId}`
  (body recovered by `ArticleController::remoteArticleBody()`: it prefers discrete `introtext` /
  `fulltext` attributes if the API ever exposes them — a Joomla PR proposes this — otherwise it
  splits the combined `text` attribute on a read-more marker it carries (`ContentSplitter`, which
  since gh-71 accepts Joomla's own `<hr id="system-readmore">` as readily as our class form), and
  only failing *that* on the `"\r\n \r\n"` separator Joomla inserts between the two parts; the
  recovered split is re-emitted as the editor's `<hr class="readmore">` marker so it survives the
  round-trip to publishing; category
  and tags come from the JSON:API `relationships` block, which `ApiClient::flatten()` preserves,
  tag IDs resolved to titles) and
  ⚠️ **`remoteFieldValues()` brings the article's custom field values across too, unsupported types
  included** (gh-59). com_content's `JsonapiView::prepareItem()` writes each field onto the item as a
  **top-level attribute named after the field** (`$item->{$field->name} = $field->apivalue ??
  $field->rawvalue`), so they arrive beside `title`/`alias` and not under a `com_fields` block, and
  `displayItem()` appends every field name to `$fieldsToRenderItem` so they are actually serialised.
  Three rules:
  - **Only `list`/`radio`/`checkboxes` define an `apivalue`**, and it is a *value => label* map — the
    **keys** are what has to go back to the site. `checkboxes` keeps them all; `list`/`radio` are
    single-value controls here, so a field the site reports **more than one** value for is
    deliberately **not** imported: an empty sidebar control is harmless (an omitted `com_fields` key
    leaves the site's value alone), whereas keeping the first of several and saving would drop the
    rest. Everything else is `rawvalue`, taken verbatim.
  - **An unsupported type's value is imported even though nothing renders it.** That is the point:
    holding it is what lets `PublishService` satisfy a required field Grafida cannot edit instead of
    refusing the publish outright. It survives an edit because `collectDraftFormData()` seeds
    `fields` from `State.currentDraft.fields` before the rendered inputs overwrite it.
  - **The field list is read best-effort**, scoped through `FieldCategoryScope::forCategory()` — an
    unreachable site costs the values, never the article.
  It opens as an **unsaved** draft — drafts (new or imported) are only written to the DB on
  the first Save, so an unchanged remote article leaves no local draft.
  The remote-article list (`GET /api/sites/{id}/articles`) is a **paginated, sorted and
  filtered** browse, mirroring Joomla's back-end article list: `ApiController::remoteArticles()`
  reads `page`/`limit`/`ordering`/`direction` plus the supported filters (`search`, `category`,
  `tag`, `language`, `state`, `featured`, `checked_out`) from the query string, validates the
  sort column against a whitelist (`ARTICLE_ORDERING`, drawn from the model's `filter_fields`),
  and forwards them to the REST API as `list[ordering|direction]` + `filter[…]` + `page[limit|
  offset]`. `ApiClient::listArticlesPage()` returns the page's items **and** the pagination total
  (Joomla's `meta['total-pages']`). Default sort is `a.id` desc. The Articles page is split into
  two tabs — **Local Articles** and **Remote Articles** (`State.articlesTab`, default `drafts`;
  the user-facing label is “Local Articles” but the internal entity/state/routes remain *draft*) —
  each with its own filter/sort toolbar, list and prev/next pagination. The tab strip carries a
  right-aligned **network-activity indicator** (`#articles-net-indicator`): `apiFetch()` keeps a
  global in-flight-request counter (`netActivityCount`) and `updateNetActivityIndicator()` shows a
  spinner + the `GRAFIDA_MSG_LOADING` label while the counter is > 0, so it is clear whether data
  is still loading. The Remote Articles tab
  renders the server-paginated toolbar (search, sort column + direction, category/tag/language/
  state/featured/checked-out dropdowns, per-page limit, clear-filters). The Local Drafts tab
  offers the same shape, but drafts are loaded in full per visit and **searched/sorted/filtered/
  paginated entirely client-side** (`filteredSortedDrafts()` / `renderDraftsTab()`); its toolbar
  is the subset of fields a draft actually carries (search over title+alias; sort by
  modified/created/title/category/language/state, defaulting to **Date modified desc** — a working
  list, so what you touched last comes first, matching the `updated_at DESC` order
  `DraftRepository::listBySite()` already returns; category/tag/language/state filters; per-page
  limit) — no featured/checked-out/hits/author controls, and (unlike the remote tab) **no id sort**:
  the id a local row shows is the *Joomla* id of the article it mirrors, which a draft only has once
  published, so ordering by it would sort half the list by a value the other half lacks. The two
  date sorts run off `Draft::toArray()`'s `createdAt`/`updatedAt` — naive UTC `Y-m-d H:i:s` exactly
  as stored, which the SPA compares **as strings** (that format sorts lexicographically in
  chronological order), never via `Date.parse()`, which WKWebView mishandles for the naive form (the
  same trap as `ai_chats.last_response_at`). `DraftExportService` enumerates its fields explicitly
  rather than using `toArray()`, so the timestamps stay out of the `.grafida` format. Because drafts
  store tag *titles* (not ids),
  the drafts tab's tag filter matches on title. The drafts tab's **empty state**
  (`buildDraftsEmptyState()`) is two-way: when the filters merely exclude everything it is the
  plain `GRAFIDA_MSG_NO_DRAFTS` line, but when there are **no drafts at all** it shows
  `GRAFIDA_MSG_NO_DRAFTS_YET` plus the two ways out — a primary **New article** button
  (`openNewArticle()`) and a secondary **List site articles** button
  (`GRAFIDA_BTN_LIST_SITE_ARTICLES`, switches to the Remote Articles tab). A remote article that
  is already mirrored by a local draft (same site + `remote_id`) **stays** in the remote list
  (it is not hidden), tagged with an extra `GRAFIDA_LBL_HAS_LOCAL_DRAFT` "Local article" badge and
  a left accent; clicking it opens the existing draft rather than re-importing the article
  (`openEditorFor()` reuses the matching draft). Both tabs render each row through the shared
  `buildArticleItem()`, whose title is preceded by a fixed-width (`fa-fw`) **publish-state icon**
  (`articleStateIcon()` / the `ARTICLE_STATE_ICONS` map): check/green published, xmark/red
  unpublished, box-archive/blue archived, trash/muted trashed. The colours follow Joomla's
  semantics; a distinct glyph per state (plus a `role="img"` + `aria-label`) is what carries the
  meaning without them. Between that icon and the title sits the **Joomla article id**
  (`articleJoomlaId()`, rendered as a muted monospace `#123`) — on a remote row its own `id`; on a
  local row the `remoteId` of the article it mirrors, since a draft's `id` is a key in our own
  `drafts` table and means nothing on the site. A draft that has never been published therefore
  shows no id at all, which is exactly why the drafts tab offers no id sort. Below the alias sits
  the **created/modified line** (`articleDatesLine()`, gh-53), which needed no API work at all:
  `created` and `modified` are both in com_content's `$fieldsToRenderList`, so the *list* endpoint
  emits them per item and `ApiClient::flatten()` hands every attribute through untouched — a
  contract `ArticleRoutingTest` now pins, since an attribute whitelist added to `flatten()` would
  drop the dates from both tabs silently. On a **local** row the dates are the draft's own
  `createdAt`/`updatedAt`, describing the local copy rather than the article on the site — which is
  what that tab lists. Each date is its own `<span>` — `created` left, `modified` pushed to the
  right edge by `margin-left: auto` on its **own class** rather than by `justify-content` or
  `:last-child`, so a row carrying only one of the two still lands on its own side — and each
  label is bold, built with **`formatNodesStrong()`** so `"Created: %s"` stays one translatable
  unit (see CLAUDE.md's Conventions). Below a **480px container** the pair stacks, both
  left-aligned: that is an `@container article-row` query on `.article-item-info`, **not** a media
  query, because collapsing either sidebar changes the row's width without touching the viewport's;
  480px is set by the widest shipped language (el-GR needs ~437px against ~310px for the rest), and
  the block simply never matching (unsupported `container-type`) leaves every row on the wide
  layout, which `flex-wrap: wrap` keeps from overflowing.
  ⚠️ Rendering them needs a real `Date`, so they go through
  **`js/util/datetime.js`** (`formatStamp()` in `app.js` is the guarded wrapper) rather than
  `Date.parse()`, which WKWebView mishandles for the naive UTC form — the same trap the date
  *sorts* dodge by comparing the strings directly. The API only accepts a
  **single** category/tag and an INT `state`, so there is no multi-select or "all states"; an
  author filter is omitted (no local user list).
  `DraftExportService` builds and consumes the portable **`.grafida`** file format (plain JSON
  under a `.grafida` extension): every visible field, saved AI chats and any locally-picked
  (not-yet-published) images, but **never** `site_id`/`remote_id` or the local `media_blobs`/
  `ai_services` row ids (those are local-install specifics with no portable meaning). A
  `grafida-media://N` sentinel in `images.image_intro`/`image_fulltext` is resolved to an
  embedded base64 blob under `offlineMedia`, keyed by an export-local ref (`grafida-media://
  export:mN` — the `m` prefix stops PHP auto-casting a numeric-looking key to an int). **Inline
  body images went through the same treatment in gh-36**: an `<img>` referencing a local blob is
  now a `boson://app/api/media/{id}/raw` reference, not a self-carrying `data:` URI, so
  `exportHtml()` walks the body for that prefix (via `InlineMedia::idFromLocalUrl()`, public for
  exactly this reuse) and embeds each referenced blob under `offlineMedia` too — deduped by blob
  id within one export, so two `<img>` tags pointing at the same picture embed it once. Import's
  `importHtml()` mirrors this: it rematerialises each ref as a **fresh** blob (sharing the same
  `$resolvedRefs`/dedup map the intro/full-text loop uses, so a ref reused by both a subfield and
  the body still becomes one new row) and points the rewritten `<img>` at the new blob's
  `LocalMediaUrl`. A **legacy** export (from before gh-36, still carrying real `data:` URIs in
  `html`) is handled too: import finishes by running `InlineImageExtractor::extract()` over the
  result, the same conversion a legacy *draft* gets on open (see `src/Media/` below), so an old
  `.grafida` file still ends up with local-URL references. `FORMAT_VERSION` is `2` (informational
  only — nothing gates on it; the importer handles both shapes unconditionally). Export asks for a
  destination **folder** (the shell's `select-folder` dialog; its token comes back as
  `X-Shell-File-Path`, gh-85) rather than a file name, and writes `<alias-or-title>.grafida` into it
  server-side; import reuses the existing open-file dialog with a new
  `'grafida'` filter. Two import endpoints: `POST /api/drafts/import` (`importAsNewDraft()`) —
  creates a brand-new draft on the given site — and `POST /api/drafts/{id}/import`
  (`replaceDraft()`) — used by the editor's "Replace from file…" button to overwrite an
  **already-open, just-saved** draft's content and saved AI chats while explicitly preserving
  its own id/`site_id`/`remote_id`, so a replaced draft stays linked to the same site and
  (if any) the same remote article.
