# The documentation (`docs/`)

(gh-55.)

`docs/` is a **single source with two consumers**: the in-app **Help** screen (`src/Help/`,
`src/Http/Controller/HelpController.php`, the SPA's `help` screen), and the Grafida.app
Documentation section, uploaded over SFTP by `scripts/upload-docs.sh` (`composer docs:publish`).
The upload is **verbatim** (every page, `docs/images/` and `_manifest.json`) since the website
renders the files as-is. Run it whenever `docs/` changes — it is not a release step, and the
procedure is `build/readme/05-documentation-publishing.md`.

The website and app deliberately share one predictable source format.

## Source-format rules

- **One flat directory, one file per page.** The file name is the page slug:
  `Custom-API-Access.md` → the website's "Custom API Access" page. Slugs are `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` — that
  same character class is the route placeholder (`{key}`) *and* the file name, so a space or a
  slash in a slug is not a style question, it is a 404.
- ⚠️ **No YAML front matter.** Page metadata lives in `docs/_manifest.json` instead.
- ⚠️ **Every page must be listed in `docs/_manifest.json`, and nothing is discovered by scanning.**
  This is not a preference: `glob()` does not work on a `phar://` path, and the docs are read
  straight out of the compiled binary. A manifest-driven index is what lets
  `Support\Resources::docsDir()` skip the extraction step that `language/` and
  `storage/migrations/` need. `tests/Feature/HelpRoutingTest::testEveryAdvertisedPageRenders()`
  renders every advertised page, so a manifest entry whose file was renamed fails the suite rather
  than becoming a dead link.
- ⚠️ **The manifest nests; the files do not.** A manifest node is
  `{slug?, title, children?}`, to a depth of `HelpService::MAX_DEPTH` (4). A node with no `slug` is
  a **heading** — a section with no page of its own, so a section never has to invent a landing
  page just to exist. But the `.md` files stay in **one flat directory** however deep the tree
  goes, because the website's manifest-driven builder expects a flat page namespace. The
  hierarchy lives in the manifest and nowhere else; do not mirror it as subdirectories.
  Two parser rules worth knowing: a node with an *unusable* slug is dropped **whole, children
  included** (it cannot be linked to, so its subtree would be orphaned under an unreachable
  section), and a heading whose children all fell away is dropped too. Because a node is discarded
  *after* its children are parsed, the flat slug index is built by walking the **finished** tree
  (`indexOf()`), never accumulated on the way down — anything recorded during the descent could
  belong to a subtree that no longer exists.
- **Links between pages are bare relative page names**:
  `[Custom API access](Custom-API-Access)`. A `.md` suffix and a `#fragment` are stripped from the
  slug.
- **Images live in `docs/images/`, flat, referenced as `images/foo.png`.** The renderer rewrites
  that to `/api/help/image/foo.png` by **basename**, so a subdirectory would 404 in the app.
  ⚠️ **They ship inside every package** (`docs/` is in `shell-package.json`'s `phar.include`), so a
  screenshot's file size is multiplied by every platform we build. Full-resolution 2× PNG captures
  run 0.5–0.7 MB each; run every new one through
  `magick <in> -strip -colors 256 PNG8:<out>` before committing, which is ~3× smaller and visually
  indistinguishable for UI chrome. Screen shots are the whole window (macOS chrome included, matching
  the hand-taken ones); a dialog is cropped to the dialog, as `site.png` is.
  A shot with more to it than fits — a long Diagnose Connection panel — is cropped with a white
  fade at the cut rather than ending abruptly.
  ⚠️ **A screenshot showing the table of contents (`help.png`) goes stale the moment
  `_manifest.json` changes.** Re-take it in the same commit.
  The `verify` skill's HTTP bridge + Chromium harness is how these are produced without a native
  window: it drives the real SPA against the real `Kernel`, so a capture is the shipping UI, not a
  mock-up. Point `db.path` at a **copy** of the real database and never at
  `Paths::databaseFile()` itself.
- **GitHub's alert blockquotes are supported** — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`,
  `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`, written exactly as GitHub wants them. They are *not* part of the
  GFM spec (they are a GitHub rendering feature), so CommonMark's GFM extension does not implement
  them and `HelpService::styleAlerts()` synthesises the callout for the app; the source is untouched
  and the website can apply matching styling. An **unrecognised** marker (`> [!SOMETHING]`) is
  deliberately left as a plain blockquote, which is what GitHub does with it too.
- **Keep the `# H1`** at the top of each file. It is what makes the file readable on its own, in
  the repository and on GitHub's blob view, and the website uses it as the page heading.
- **The documentation is English only**, deliberately. The two consumers share one source. Only the Help screen's
  *chrome* (filter box, buttons, error states) is translated, through the usual
  `language/en-GB/en-GB.ini` + `UiStrings::KEYS` route.

## Rendering (`src/Help/HelpService.php`)

GitHub-Flavoured Markdown with `html_input => 'allow'`. That combination is what makes the two
consumers **agree**: the GFM extension bundles `DisallowedRawHtml`, so exactly the tags GitHub
neutralises (`<script>`, `<style>`, `<iframe>` …) are escaped here too, while the ones a manual
legitimately needs (`<kbd>`, `<sub>`) survive in both places. Stripping HTML outright would have
been safer in the abstract and *wrong* in practice — a page would mean two different things
depending on where it was read.

Two `DocumentParsedEvent` listeners then transform the **AST** — never a regex over the rendered
HTML, because at AST level a URL is unambiguously a URL and a blockquote unambiguously a blockquote,
with no guessing about quoting or about what is inside a fenced code block:

- `rewriteReferences()` retargets links and images (see the link table below).
- `styleAlerts()` turns GitHub's alert blockquotes into callouts. The marker parses as a single
  `Text` node followed by a `Newline` (the unmatched `[` never becomes a link), so it is removed as
  those two nodes and a title paragraph is prepended, carrying the level's icon and label. The icon
  is a real `<i class="fa-solid fa-…" aria-hidden="true">` element, **not** a CSS `content:`
  codepoint — `app.css` hard-codes no glyph anywhere, and a class name cannot silently point at a
  different picture when FontAwesome renumbers. The five labels (Note/Tip/Important/Warning/Caution)
  are English and stay English: they sit inside an English document, so they are deliberately not in
  `UiStrings::KEYS`. In CSS each level sets one `--alert` custom property and the border, tint and
  title colour all read it, so adding a level is one rule rather than four. This is why the converter is assembled by hand
(`new Environment` + `CommonMarkCoreExtension` + `GithubFlavoredMarkdownExtension`) rather than
using `GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter`, which does not expose an `Environment` to add a listener
to. `Markdown\MarkdownService` (the *import* feature) is a separate, simpler converter and is
unrelated.

⚠️ **The SPA writes a rendered page with `innerHTML`** — the only whole-document `innerHTML` in the
app. That is safe *because of where the HTML comes from*: `docs/` ships inside the binary and is
never user input, and PHP has already applied GitHub's own escaping. Never point `openHelpPage()`
at anything fetched from a site.

## ⚠️ No link in a documentation page may be followed normally

This is the rule most easily broken by someone adding a link and assuming a browser is a browser.
The app's webview **opens no new window**, so a `target="_blank"` anchor does nothing at all; and a
same-window navigation would replace the entire SPA with the remote page, with no way back — there
is no chrome, no Back button and no history UI. This is the same constraint that made the TinyMCE
Help dialog's link-only tabs unshippable (gh-21).

So every anchor is classified at render time by `HelpService::rewriteReferences()` and acted on by
the delegated handler in `initHelpLinks()`:

| Link in the Markdown | Tagged | What a click does |
|---|---|---|
| `[x](Other-Page)` — relative | `data-help-page="Other-Page"` | `openHelpPage()`, in-app |
| `[x](https://…#frag)` | `data-help-external="1"` | `api.openUrl()` → `Support\UrlOpener` → OS browser, fragment intact |
| `[x](mailto:…)`, other schemes | *nothing* | swallowed — see below |
| `[x](#section)` | *nothing* | left to the browser, which scrolls the pane |

⚠️ **`mailto:` and friends are deliberately left untagged.** `UrlOpener::open()` accepts **http(s)
only** and throws otherwise, so tagging them external would turn a click into an error toast —
worse than nothing. The href stays intact so the link still reads correctly on the website, and the
SPA's handler ends with a catch-all `preventDefault()` for any non-fragment anchor it did not
classify, so an unclassified link can never navigate the webview away. CommonMark's
`allow_unsafe_links => false` has already removed `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:` and `file:`
before any of this runs.

## Routes

`GET /api/help` (table of contents), `GET /api/help/page/{key}`, `GET /api/help/image/{file}`.
`{file}` is a placeholder type added to `Http\Router` for this (`name.ext`, no slash, no bare
`..`), so a traversal attempt matches no pattern and dies at the router's 404 — the file-name check
in `HelpService::image()` is defence in depth, not the only guard.

None of it touches a site, the network or the database, so **the Help screen works with nothing
configured at all** — which is exactly when someone is most likely to open it. Keep it that way.

## Contextual help

Any element anywhere in the SPA carrying **`data-help-page="Some-Slug"`** opens the Help screen on
that page — a document-level delegation in `initHelpLinks()`, excluding `#help-page` itself so a
link inside a rendered page is not handled twice. A contextual help button is therefore **pure
markup** in `view/index.html`: it localises its tooltip through `applyStrings()`'s existing
`data-i18n-title` pass and needs no JavaScript of its own.

Every screen reachable from the sidebar carries one, pointing at that screen's own **Reference**
page: Sites, Articles, Media Manager, Settings and Request Log. The Help screen itself does not —
`Help.md` documents it, but that page is already visible in the screen's own table of contents, so a
button there would be pure noise. A new screen gets a button *and* a Reference page; never a button
pointing at a page that does not exist yet.

⚠️ **Write the button as a SIBLING of the screen's action container, never inside it.**
`#media-header-actions`, `#requestlog-actions` and `#help-actions` are all cleared and rebuilt by
their render functions (`renderMediaHeaderActions()`, `renderRequestLogScreen()`,
`renderHelpActions()`), which would destroy a static button placed within them — silently, and only
from the second render onwards.

## Publishing to Grafida.app (`scripts/upload-docs.sh`)

`composer docs:publish` uploads `docs/` to the site's documentation directory over SFTP: every
`*.md` page, everything in `docs/images/` (into an `images/` directory it creates if needed), and
`_manifest.json`. `--dry-run` prints the destination and the whole SFTP batch without connecting to
anything. The settings are `docs.sftp.host` / `.path` / `.user` / `.port` in
`build/build.properties`, overridden by `DOCS_SFTP_*` in the environment;
`build/readme/05-documentation-publishing.md` is the full procedure.

⚠️ **This is deliberately NOT a release step and must not become one.** The app serves Help out of
its own binary, so the site and the shipped build are independent: a typo fix is worth publishing
the day it is committed, and a release does not require the site to be republished. That is also why
there is no `phing` target for it — the release target is where a step would inevitably be added.

⚠️ **The manifest is uploaded LAST**, after every page it points at, so a reader who loads the site
mid-upload sees the old table of contents rather than a new entry linking to a page the server does
not have yet. Two preflight checks run before the connection: a manifest slug with no matching file
is fatal, and a page no manifest entry names is a warning.

⚠️ **Nothing is ever deleted from the server.** A renamed or dropped page keeps its old file, still
served at its old URL, until somebody removes it by hand — in the same session, because nothing in
this repository can tell you it is there. The in-app Help is correct either way.

⚠️ **Do not add a key or password setting.** The connection is `~/.ssh/config`'s business, and its
`IdentityAgent` line points ssh at 1Password's SSH agent, which authorises every connection with a
biometric prompt. `sftp -b` implies `BatchMode=yes`, which suppresses ssh's own prompts but not the
agent's separate window; what it does break is an unknown host key, so the host must be connected to
by hand once.
