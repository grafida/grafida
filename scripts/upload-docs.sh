#
# Publishes the in-app Help pages to the Grafida.app site over SFTP.
#
#     scripts/upload-docs.sh [--dry-run] [--verbose]
#
# The pages under docs/ are BOTH the app's own Help (inside every package's worker PHAR —
# shell-package.json's phar.include lists docs/) and the public documentation at grafida.app. This script mirrors the
# second from the first. It uploads the Markdown pages, `_manifest.json` and everything in
# `docs/images/` — nothing else in the directory, and no other subdirectory, because the
# documentation set is deliberately flat apart from that one image folder
# (.claude/rules/documentation.md).
#
# ⚠️ **This is NOT a release step**, which is why it is its own script and its own document
# (build/readme/05-documentation-publishing.md). A typo fix, a corrected instruction or a new
# screenshot is worth publishing the day it is committed; waiting for the next release would leave
# the site wrong for weeks. The reverse is also true — the site can be republished without building
# anything, and an installed copy keeps whatever pages it shipped with.
#
# ⚠️ **The manifest is uploaded LAST, deliberately.** It is the table of contents; every other file
# is a page it points at. Sending it after its pages means a reader who loads the site mid-upload
# sees the old contents, never a new entry linking to a page that is not there yet.
#
# ⚠️ **Nothing is ever deleted from the server.** A page renamed or dropped from the documentation
# set leaves its old file behind, still reachable by its old URL. Remove it by hand, in the same
# session, or the site keeps serving a page the app no longer has.
#
# CONFIGURATION
#
# Read from build/build.properties (the gitignored private build configuration — copy
# build/build.sample.properties and fill it in) or from the environment, which wins:
#
#   docs.sftp.host    DOCS_SFTP_HOST    required   the ~/.ssh/config Host alias to connect to (a
#                                                  real hostname works too, but see below for why
#                                                  the alias is the point)
#   docs.sftp.path    DOCS_SFTP_PATH    required   the target directory, absolute or relative to
#                                                  the login directory. It must already exist; the
#                                                  script does not create it.
#   docs.sftp.user    DOCS_SFTP_USER    optional   only if ~/.ssh/config sets `User` for the host.
#                                                  ⚠️ **Without either, ssh connects as your LOCAL
#                                                  login name**, which on shared hosting is never
#                                                  the right account — set one or the other.
#   docs.sftp.port    DOCS_SFTP_PORT    optional   omit it and ~/.ssh/config's `Port` for the host
#                                                  applies, itself defaulting to 22
#
# ⚠️ **The connection is `~/.ssh/config`'s business, not this script's.** Identity, user, port,
# jump hosts and agent all come from the entry for the host. That is deliberate: the key lives in
# 1Password, reached through its SSH agent by an `IdentityAgent` line in that file, and every
# connection is authorised by a biometric prompt the agent raises itself. There is consequently
# **no key setting here, and no password setting, and neither should be added** — a path to a key
# file would route around the agent.
#
# ⚠️ **`sftp -b` implies `BatchMode=yes`**, which stops *ssh* from prompting — for a password, a
# passphrase, or an unknown host key. It does not stop the 1Password prompt, which is the agent's
# own window and out of ssh's hands entirely. So the biometric prompt still appears and still has
# to be answered; what fails outright is a host that wants a password, or one whose key is not yet
# in known_hosts. Connect once by hand to accept the host key.
