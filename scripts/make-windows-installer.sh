# Output: build/dist/Grafida-<version>-windows-amd64-Setup.exe   (NSIS), or

# Sign the compiled binary itself first, so both the NSIS installer and the

# for a local 'phing git-win-x86' compile, only from packaging.
#
# CRUCIAL: grafida.exe is a phpmicro self-executable — the PE stub with the
# application PHAR appended after it. Authenticode signing appends its
# certificate table at EOF, i.e. AFTER the PHAR, which corrupts the PHAR's own
# trailing signature and makes the app die at startup with "grafida.exe has a
# broken signature" (Phar::mapPhar). So we must NEVER sign the combined binary.
#
# When grafida.exe was compiled against the patched sibling-payload SFX
# (build/sfx/windows-x86_64.standard.sfx, from the grafida/phpmicro
# `sibling-phar` fork — see build/readme/02-signing-architecture.md), we split
# it, exactly like scripts/make-macos-app.sh does for the .app bundle: the clean
# PE stub becomes grafida.exe and the payload becomes a sibling grafida.phar the
# patched stub loads at run time. Only the clean stub is signed. Everything
# packaged below (NSIS installer or portable .zip) is built from PKG_DIR.
